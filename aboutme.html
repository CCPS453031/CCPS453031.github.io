        <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>In life, I always strive for greatness. I always look to improve everything I do every day. I work towards these goals by being the best version of myself. I try to strive in both my academics and athletes.  By applying myself every day in the classroom, it gives me the ability to improve and strengthen my future. Some values that I consider most necessary for my success are kindness, honesty, creativity, and responsibility. Some short-term goals I wish to accomplish soon are to make my family proud by getting into a respected college, learn to play free bird on the guitar, and get an A in all my classes for the rest of 2023. Some character traits and achievements I want to be known for are being kind to everyone, being honest, and being and having a creative mindset. Kindness is a big part of my life and I believe people should be kind to everyone.</p>
